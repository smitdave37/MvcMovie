Get started: This step involves setting up my development environment, including installing necessary frameworks, libraries, and tools.
Add a controller: Controllers handle the application's logic and act as intermediaries between the models and views.
Add a view: Views are responsible for presenting data to the user in a readable format.





Observation: 
->	Getting started is a crucial step for me as it sets the foundation for my entire project. Ensuring that my development environment
is properly configured will save time and prevent issues down the line.
->	Controllers play a central role in web applications, handling requests and coordinating responses. Creating a controller typically 
involves defining actions to respond to different routes or user interactions.
->	Views are essential for providing a user interface and displaying information to users. They often consist of HTML templates combined
with dynamic content generated by the controller.


Done......... :)

Add a model: Models represent the application's data and define the rules for interacting with it.







Observation: Models encapsulate the data layer of the application and provide methods for querying and manipulating data. 
Defining models is crucial for maintaining data integrity and enforcing business logic.

Initial File :->

Work with a database: This involves setting up and interacting with a database to store and retrieve application data.







Observation: Choosing the right database and properly configuring it is essential for the performance and scalability of my application. 
Interacting with the database involves CRUD operations (Create, Read, Update, Delete) to manage data.

Done......... :)

Controller actions and views: This step involves defining actions in the controller and corresponding views to handle user requests and display responses.



Observation: Controller actions map to specific routes and are responsible for processing user input and generating responses. 
Views render HTML templates to present data to the user.


Done......... :)

Add search: Implementing search functionality allows users to find specific information within the application.
Add a new field: Adding a new field to a model involves updating the database schema and modifying views and controllers as necessary.



Observation: 
->	Adding search functionality enhances the user experience by enabling users to quickly locate relevant data. 
This often involves querying the database based on user input.
->	Modifying the data model requires careful consideration to ensure compatibility with existing code and data. 
Updating views and controllers allows the application to accommodate the new field.



Done......... :)

Observation: 
->	Validation helps maintain data integrity and prevents errors or inconsistencies. Validations are typically defined
within the model and are enforced when saving or updating records.
->	Providing the ability to view details and delete records is essential for managing data within the application. These actions often 
require confirmation from the user to prevent accidental deletions.




Overall Overview: 
	These steps provide a comprehensive overview of developing a web application, covering key aspects such as data modeling, user interface, and database interaction. Following these steps will help me build a functional and robust application.
